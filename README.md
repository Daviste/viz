## Getting Started

1. <a href="http://vizuly.io/download">Download</a> or copy the <a href="https://github.com/vizuly/viz">github repo</a> to your local machine.
2. Open your IDE of choice and/or go directly to any of the test files (BarChartTest.html for example) and launch the test in your browser of choice (Chrome is best.)
3. Use the testing/demo tool at the top of the window to test various styles and settings dynamically.  You can use your browser debugger to directly trace and debug code.
